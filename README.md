# Hi, I'm Taz 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Who am I?

I'm Taz, a lifelong tech enthusiast with a passion for computers and everything IT. Since I was a kid, I've loved tinkering with hardware, troubleshooting problems, and figuring out how technology works beneath the surface.

Right now, I'm studying a Intermediate Degree in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, diving deep into the world of networking, system administration, and IT troubleshooting.

## My Current Focus

- 🏡 **Homelabbing:** I spend a lot of my free time building, configuring, and experimenting with my own home lab. I use this space to test setups, break things (on purpose!), and learn by doing.
- 🐧 **Linux & Ubuntu Server:** I work with Linux daily, especially Ubuntu Server. I enjoy setting up self-hosted services, automating tasks, and optimizing server environments.
- 🪟 **Windows (Personal & Enterprise):** I don't just stick to Linux—I also work with Windows systems, both for my personal use and with an eye towards enterprise environments.
- 🛠️ **Hands-on Learning:** I’m the sort of person who learns by doing. I’m always running a new experiment, setting up a new service, or looking for problems to solve.

## What to Expect Here

On my GitHub you'll find guides, notes, and project documentation for everything I’m working on—especially things that might help others in the homelab or IT community. My goal is to make resources that are clear, practical, and genuinely useful for people getting into IT, Linux, or home labs.

If you share these interests, want to learn together, or just want to see what I’m up to, feel free to follow or reach out!
